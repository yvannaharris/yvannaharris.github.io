      <p>One of the brightest and gentlest of the toys, the Maltese is exceedingly playful and enjoys clever games of dexterity such as "pull the hidden toy from under the cabinet with your paw."</p>

      <p>This curious, quick-moving sprite doesn't need much outdoor exercise, but he does enjoy dashing around the (fenced!) yard and accompanying you for walks. Larger dogs may view him as a delicacy, so a Maltese must always be leashed or fenced for his own protection. Fences should be triple-checked for slight gaps through which he might wriggle.</p>

      <p>Maltese are generally peaceful with the world, though some lines (and individuals) are more confident and outgoing, and some are more standoffish or cautious.</p>

      <p>Training and socialization also play key roles in how a Maltese turns out. If you treat him like a helpless baby or spoil/indulge him, he is likely to end up overdependent, insecure, or bratty and yappy. You should require him to show the same good manners as you would expect from a larger dog, and this is easily accomplished because Maltese respond very well to respect training.</p>

      <p>Very sensitive and responsive to nonforceful training, many Maltese excel in competitive obedience and agility. However, they are notoriously difficult to housebreak -- consider an indoor litterbox, or a doggy door leading outside to a small covered potty yard. Excessive barking may also need to be controlled.</p>
